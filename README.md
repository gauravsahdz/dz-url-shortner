# Link Shortener

This is a link shortener project that utilizes the Rapid API for URL shortening. You can use your own API keys to make it work.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file located in the root directory:

- `API_URL`: The URL of the Rapid API endpoint.
- `API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing the Rapid API.
- `API_HOST`: The host name for the Rapid API.

## Rapid API

We are using the [URL Shortener Service](https://rapidapi.com/BigLobster/api/url-shortener-service/) from Rapid API. You can sign up for an account and obtain your own API keys to use with this project.

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment variables and obtained your API keys, you can start using the link shortener service.
